### The Artsy Omakase

We gave our JavaScript stack for web and iOS the name "Artsy Omakase" and it represents using:

- React
- Relay
- GraphQL
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Storybooks
- Jest
- VS Code

To create a coherent development environment with great developer tools that makes it really easy to fall into the
pit of success. You can watch an overview video from @orta
[on Artsy's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3loALSVQM&t=912s) from our React Native conference in 2018.
