When I was a junior, I interviewed to join a design agency who were doing Mac development too. It was pretty nerve racking to apply for my first programming job, and I came into the interview with no idea what to expect.

Now that I'm involved with so many juniors in NYC, I'm meeting with a lot of people who are in the same position and I get a lot of questions asking what they can do to prepare. This post _attempts_ at being a comprehensive collection of recommendations. I will also try to link to others as much as possible, each link should be a springboard.

Before I jump through to the article, there's one thing that should be above the fold. _Chill out_. You might not get it right on the first try, I've applied for jobs and received a "no thanks." Yet eventually I got here.
