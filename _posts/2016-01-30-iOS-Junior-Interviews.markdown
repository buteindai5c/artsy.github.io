When I was at the beginning of my career, my first developer job application was to a design agency who were doing Mac development too. It was pretty nerve racking to apply for my first programming job, and I came into the interview with no idea what to expect.

Now that I'm both further on in my career, and involved with so many juniors in NYC, I'm meeting with a lot of people who are in the same position and I get a lot of questions asking what they can do to prepare. This post _attempts_ at being a comprehensive collection of recommendations. It is subjective, of course, and strongly based towards my experiences.

Before I jump through to the article, there's one thing that should be above the fold. _Chill out_. You might not get it right on the first try, I've applied for jobs and received a "no thanks." Yet eventually I got here. Everyone finds their place in time.

### On Your Readiness

No-one starting out is ever ready, and an individual is [never really "done"](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/you-never-arrive/). However, in this [post @dbgrandi](http://dbgrandi.github.io/minimum_viable_programmer/) neatly sums up the bar.

> I had a long list of specific things relating to Xcode and iOS. They were very tedious things like, ‚Äúyou should know how to add a new file to an Xcode project.‚Äù I‚Äôve shortened that list to a general description here.

> I expect you to be able to start a new project, write some code to download a bit of JSON via HTTP, and use the parsed JSON to present some data in a UITableView.

> If you can do that, in a well organized manner, and can discuss the choices you made to get your app built you‚Äôll have been able to do almost everything that was on that long and tedious list.

This is a great starting point. In an ideal world, an interviewer isn't going to to judge you on not knowing every detail about the whole system. They will have expectations that you're going to have to learn on the job for a lot of things, and that's ok.

### On the lookout

There are a bunch of websites for putting up job adverts. 

- [StackOverflow jobs](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
- [Natasha The Robot's Swift Jobs](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-jobs/)
- [Core Intuition's Jobs Board](http://jobs.coreint.org)
- [Apple's Jobs Site](https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/)

These kind of things work, I got my first programming job through [CocoaDev Jobs](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/174142-ann-cocoadev-jobs-board.html).

These are great, but in my opinion the best way to find out what companies are hiring is to attend meet-ups in the city. In NYC we have 3-4 big iOS meet-ups a month, and all of them give a chance for people looking for others to work to speak up. You might not live in as big of a city, but I used to travel an hour to Manchester to attend a meet-up, they would have the same thing, I almost became a full-time rubyist because of it. I have quite a few friends in NYC who started their careers by talking to someone at a meet-up.

Generic job websites can be good, for example Artsy's job postings are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/artsy) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Job/Artsy-Jobs-E793485.htm) but the vast majority of the incoming applicants from them feel like they were sent to a lot of companies. They are given a low priority when compared to direct inquiries because of this. I can't speak from experience but [Ladders](https://www.theladders.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Hired](http://hired.com) and [weworkremotely](https://weworkremotely.com) are probably worth a look too.

If you see an advert for a mobile developer, but they don't mention juniors, you should apply anyway. We've never had junior positions on our jobs pages, but have hired some who inquired anyway. Don't pretend to be more senior than you are though, set the right expectations. 

Finally, consult your network, talk to people at meet ups, sneakily contribute to open source projects with people you want to talk to and then email the project owner after they've got to know your name.

### On a Coffee

Know what goes a long way? Talking with someone before applying. I regularly get coffee with applicants or potential applicants when I'm in NYC. Coffee can be hard when applying for junior roles when remote, but so far, to my knowledge I've not talked to anyone who hires a junior as a remote developer. I'm not sure it could work unless the entire team was remote, or the junior developer had a lot of experience and was only a junior in the sense that they were just hitting the work-force.

These are 15-30 minute informal chats, but from an employers perspective they are definitely a good way to filter candidates. A coffee is time-cheap, interviews are time-expensive. So ask someone on the dev team to do them, you'll usually get a yes. Tamar Nachmany has some [great, salient points](https://booleancubes.tumblr.com/post/137057622039/the-networking-with-awesome-strangers-checklist) on the right way to pitch these emails.

### On an Intro Email

Look at the language in the jobs page, and have your email / intro letter reflect that. When I receive very formal "dear hiring manager" emails it reflects badly on the applicant, [our jobs page](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-jobs-mobile-engineer) states to not worry about that, as we're not that kind of culture.

An intro email is your chance to show that you understand the core value of a company. For example when I receive applications that only talk about our contributions to OSS then I wonder if they've even studied what Artsy is, and how OSS by Default is derived from deeper values as opposed to being an end-goal in itself. If you apply to Facebook and the only thing you mention is [React-Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) I think you'd also be missing the point of Facebook. A great opener to Facebook might talk about how amazing it is that they can work on a product that pretty much everyone they meet uses, and so do 1 billion a day. It shows you understand the scope of their problems, and have done your homework.




### On a Portfolio

_on wording_: I use the word portfolio, to encapsulate a CV/Resume/Design Portfolio. They all have specific meanings, but in this case, I mean something you attach to the email to provide the full context of your history/experiences.

There are a lot of places for good, solid advice on the document you are using to persuade someone to interview you. So I'll tell you what has worked for me. I think it should be a one page document, that captures a snapshot of you. Things they must have: your name, a way to contact you and a list of things you think is relevant. Ideally it's going to be one page. 

You should consider what you think are qualities that you bring to the table, for some job applications I have submitted both a resume and a design portfolio. If you are particularly proud of your design work, perhaps find a way to include your app store screenshots and branding?


##### On Representing Myself

I dug through my archives and found every resume I have ever created; ranging from my first as a student, through to last year.

- [2007](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2007-144.jpg) as a part of the WWDC Student Scholarship. It was significantly less competitive then.
- [2008](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2008-general-144.jpg) as a graduate applying for jobs that were not programming focused.
- [2008](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2008-programming-144.jpg) as a graduate applying for programming jobs.
- [2010](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2010-144.jpg) when applying for jobs once I had stopped being a junior.
- [2015](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2015-144.jpg) my CV as a part of my U.S. VISA process.

You can definitely get a sense of my skill specialisations happening over the last 8 years, but the tone of how I present myself hasn't really changed.

I also consider my personal web-page [orta.io](http://orta.io) to act as a portfolio, Ash Furrow's portfolio page has a [similar vibe](https://ashfurrow.com/portfolio/).

##### On the team 

Want to know what the resumes looked like for people applying to Artsy? I asked some of our team to send me their last resumes

A portfolio can be whatever you want it to be. You could spend forever on a portfolio, but it's really just an exercise in restraint and prioritisation. Eventually it's been shaved to a point where you can remove nothing more.

_More inf√∂ that I've reviewed and given a üëç:_

* [iOS Developer Resume Examples](http://www.raywenderlich.com/54029/ios-developer-resume-examples) - Somehow I ended up sneaking on this article too.
* [8 Minute Guide to Writing a Resume](https://rooting-for-you.cenedella.com/8-minute-resume-my-guide-to- writing-your-resume-effectively-3b0b117d94a#.ouqnzegkh) - Marc has a lot of experience in this space, plus his advice is definitely better if you're focusing on larger companies. 
 

### On The One

So you know exactly who you are interested in applying to. One of your passions in life is to make music, and you think being a engineer at Spotify would be a dream job. How do you increase your chances?

First up, you should have some experience before you apply. Apply at one or two other companies that you'd also really like to work for first, test out the water. Then for Spotify, you should make sure everything is perfect for them. Write a new CV and mention your band on it, include links to your music in the bottom. Consider Maxim's portfolio above, this was obviously made specifically for an audience of Arts/Tech people, Sarah's also talks about activism and art projects. These are well-tuned portfolios for an audience of Artsy.

A lot of companies have public employee get-togethers, for example at Artsy we have weekly Happy Hour in the office, or [Peer Labs](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/) where you can meet a lot of the people working at a company. This is a great way to mine the employees for information about the culture and to try and peek behind the curtain. In the case of Spotify, they host a lot of meet-ups, try attending some at their offices.

### On Interview Preparation

So you've got an interview

Be cautious with links on the internet here, some of the [top](http://www.raywenderlich.com/53962/ios-interview-questions) [links](http://www.geekinterview.com/Interview-Questions/iOS) [to](http://way2ios.com/development/ios-development-2/ios-interview-questions-with-answers/) [search](http://www.toptal.com/ios/interview-questions) here are probably not great for people starting. They aim at a different audience, or focus on minutae that juniors probably don't know.

There's a lot of value in a collection of interview questions though, one that IMO is a solid resource is [CameronBanga/iOS-Developer-and-Designer-Interview-Questions](https://github.com/CameronBanga/iOS-Developer-and-Designer-Interview-Questions) on GitHub. You could get asked a few of these.

One book that is considered the go-to for interview preparation is [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com), it's considered a great guide to some of the computer-science-y questions you could get asked.

##### I didn't study Computer Science



##### On Mocks

If you can do Mock Interviews you should. You need an existing network in order to pull that off, but you can get real feedback that can be extremely helpful. As an employer you have to be very cautious in the way you word a rejection, in a mock interview you don't. This isn't a one-sided process, the interviewer can use the chance to try out a different technique or to improve their interviewing skills. 

If you don't know anyone who can do this for you, I'd feel like there are two options: [buy a mock interview](http://www.careercup.com/interview) and befriend someone who says they're looking for someone at a meet-up - they must be interviewing so they might want a practice run too. I've given about as many mock interviews as I have done real interviews in the last 2 years.

_More inf√∂ that I've reviewed and given a üëç:_

* [So You Have a Technical Interview at Macoscope](http://macoscope.com/blog/so-you-have-a-technical-interview-at-macoscope/) - Again, probably a bit more than expected of a junior, but a great summary of how they do it 
* [How we hire](http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/hiringprocess/) - How Google's hiring process works.


### On iOS Interviews

To be at this point, a employer has already decided to invest probably something like 10 hours into you. This is spread across a few people but the point is important. To have got here, someone has to be on your side. They will have had to put in work to even get people to agree to schedule you into their day. Your mindset should reflect this, it's not you vs them. It's you and someone. Your job from here is persuading everyone else that gut feeling from that person is correct.

There is no catch-all solid advice for interviews, but I can give you some of the things we talk about in Artsy. 

We look for [T shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) engineers, even in juniors. This means someone who has experience in a pretty wide net of things, but that they have a solid focus. This could be building their APIs for apps, writing their own blog, designing their website, automating some regular tasks or using technology for art.

##### How I interview Juniors

One thing I can tell you concretely though, is what I do. My interviews with juniors come in three parts:

- A Chat

  I want to get someone comfortable with the interview, I'll have taken points from looking over the portfolio to explore. It will be a pretty one-sided conversation with me only trying to provide points to spring off. "So tell me about when you did x", ""

- Pair Programming

  Here's some details there 

- Learn you a thing

  OK

Here's [a long writeup](https://medium.com/@jon.lazar/my-approach-to-learning-ios-fccf943aead#.xo5c8iada), with a lot of depth from someone who has just come out of a mock interview with me. Thanks Jon.

### OK so I've got you, what else can I recommend?

The way in which you present yourself online will attract similar people. If you are always being negative, and it sure is easy, expect to end up surrounded with people who are similar. [Being nice is nice](https://realm.io/news/altconf-orta-therox-being-nice-in-open-source/).

If you have a blog, and it's on medium, look into making/editing your own blog. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is the defacto go-to in that space, but I know people have enjoyed using [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [hugo](http://gohugo.io). Do not use Octopress, vanilla Jekyll will do you just fine.

If you're not active on Twitter, you should start trying. Every time you think of something worth saying to someone next to you, say it to them, then say it to twitter. Show off pictures of what you're working on, reply to people with more followers than you when they ask questions. It took me 4 years to hit my first thousand followers.

When people say GitHub is your resume, they are right and they are wrong. GitHub can help get you through the door, but you can't rely on that in your interviews. Check out the advice at the [end of this post](http://code.dblock.org/2011/07/14/github-is-your-new-resume.html) on how to make your GitHub look good for people looking at whether to interview you.
