When I was at the beginning of my career, my first developer job application was to a design agency who were doing Mac development too. It was pretty nerve racking to apply for my first programming job, and I came into the interview with no idea what to expect.

Now that I'm both further on in my career, and involved with so many juniors in NYC, I'm meeting with a lot of people who are in the same position and I get a lot of questions asking what they can do to prepare. This post _attempts_ at being a comprehensive collection of recommendations. I will also try to link to others as much as possible, each link should be a springboard.

Before I jump through to the article, there's one thing that should be above the fold. _Chill out_. You might not get it right on the first try, I've applied for jobs and received a "no thanks." Yet eventually I got here.

### On Your Readiness

No-one starting out is ever ready, and an individual is never really "done". However, in this [post @dbgrandi](http://dbgrandi.github.io/minimum_viable_programmer/) neatly sums up the bar.

> I had a long list of specific things relating to Xcode and iOS. They were very tedious things like, “you should know how to add a new file to an Xcode project.” I’ve shortened that list to a general description here.

> I expect you to be able to start a new project, write some code to download a bit of JSON via HTTP, and use the parsed JSON to present some data in a UITableView.

> If you can do that, in a well organized manner, and can discuss the choices you made to get your app built you’ll have been able to do almost everything that was on that long and tedious list.

This is a great starting point. In an ideal world, an interviewer isn't going to to judge you on not knowing every detail about the whole system. They will have expectations that you're going to have to learn on the job for a lot of things, and that's ok.

### On the lookout

There are a bunch of websites for putting up job adverts. 

- [StackOverflow jobs](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
- [Natasha The Robot's Swift Jobs](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-jobs/)
- [Core Intuition's Jobs Board](http://jobs.coreint.org)
- [Apple's Jobs Site](https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/)

These kind of things work, I got my first programming job through [CocoaDev Jobs](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/174142-ann-cocoadev-jobs-board.html).

These are great, but in my opinion the best way to find out what companies are hiring is to attend meet-ups in the city. In NYC we have 3-4 big iOS meet-ups a month, and all of them give a chance for people looking for others to work to speak up. You might not live in as big of a city, but I used to travel an hour to Manchester to attend a meet-up, they would have the same thing, I almost became a full-time rubyist because of it.

Generic job websites can be good, for example Artsy's job postings are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/artsy) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Job/Artsy-Jobs-E793485.htm) but the vast majority of the incoming applicants from them feel like they were sen to a lot of companies. They are given a low priority when compared to direct inquiries because of this.

If you see an advert for a mobile developer, but they don't mention juniors, you should apply anyway. We've never had junior positions on our jobs pages, but have hired some who inquired anyway. Don't pretend to be more senior than you are though, set the right expectations. 

Finally, consult your network, talk to people at meet ups, sneakily contribute to open source projects with people you want to talk to and then email the project owner. 

### On a Coffee

Know what goes a long way? Talking with someone before applying. I regularly get coffee with applicants or potential applicants when I'm in NYC. Coffee can be hard when applying for junior roles when remote, but so far, to my knowledge I've not talked to anyone who hires a junior as a remote developer. I'm not sure it could work unless the entire team was remote, or the junior developer had a lot of experience and was only a junior in the sense that they were just hitting the work-force.

These are 15-30 minute informal chats, but from an employers perspective they are definitely a good way to filter candidates. A coffee is time-cheap, interviews are time-expensive. So ask to do them, you'll usually get a yes.

### On an Intro Email

Look at the language in the jobs page, and have your email / intro letter reflect that. When I receive very formal "dear hiring manager" emails it reflects badly on the applicant, [our page](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-jobs-mobile-engineer) states to not worry about that, as we're not that kind of culture.



### On a Portfolio

There are a lot of places for good, solid advice on the document you are using to persuade someone to interview you. So I'll tell you what has worked for me. I think it should be a one page document, that captures a snapshot of you. Things they must have: your name, a way to contact you and a list of things you think is relevant. Ideally it's going to be one page. 

You should consider what you think are qualities that you bring to the table, for some job applications I have submitted both a resume and a design portfolio. If you are particularly proud of your design work, perhaps find a way to include your app store screenshots and branding?


##### On Representing Myself

I dug through my archives and found every resume I have ever created, ranging from my first as a student to last year.

- [2007](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2007-144.jpg) as a part of the WWDC Student Scholarship. It was significantly less competitive then.
- [2008](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2008-general-144.jpg) as a graduate applying for jobs that were not programming focused.
- [2008](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2008-programming-144.jpg) as a graduate applying for programming jobs.
- [2010](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2010-144.jpg) when applying for jobs once I had stopped being a junior.
- [2015](/images/2016-01-30-iOS-Junior-Interviews/2015-144.jpg) my CV as a part of my U.S. VISA process.

You can definitely get a sense of my skill specialisations happening over the last 8 years, but the tone of how I present myself hasn't really changed.

I also consider my personal web-page [orta.io](http://orta.io) to act as a portfolio, Ash Furrow's portfolio page has a [similar vibe](https://ashfurrow.com/portfolio/).

### On The One

So you know exactly who you are interested in applying to. One of your passions in life is to make music, and you think being a engineer at Spotify would be a dream job. How do you increase your chances?

First up, you should have some experience before you apply. Apply at one or two other companies that you'd also really like to work for first, test out the water. Then for Spotify, you should make sure everything is perfect for them. Write a new CV and mention your band on it, include links to your music in the bottom. 

A lot of companies have public employee get-togethers, for example at Artsy we have weekly Happy Hour in the office, or [Peer Labs](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/) where you can meet a lot of the people working at a company. This is a great way to mine the employees for information about the culture and to try and peek behind the curtain. In the case of Spotify, they host a lot of meetups, try attending some at their offices.
