We released the fourth app from the mobile team to great fanfare, and are currently getting around 2k downloads a day. The codebase was created by a single developer, and we didn't want to keep that knowledge siloed. So, I ran an hour long code review session where I talked through the codebase, explained why some decisions were made and about the differences between tvOS and UIKit.  

Given that I had been asked to write a blog post about tvOS in general, I felt that making the code review public for anyone to watch would be a nice alternative to long-form writing.
