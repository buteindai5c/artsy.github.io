When I joined Artsy Engineering a few months ago, I had roughly 0 knowledge of Kubernetes. I'd heard the term
thrown around a few times, but had no idea how it worked or what it was good for.

Artsy also has a super cool wrapper that we use to emulate a lot of Heroku CLI functionality for Kubernetes (and to
do some other awesome stuff, read on for deets). It's fully open-source, and you should think about adopting it if
you or your company uses Kubernetes.

Read on for the full scoop.

# What is Hokusai?

General overview

# How can I set up Hokusai with my project?

Could I set up a whole new k8s cluster and Hokusai with it? Would be super cool, but I feel like it might cost
money

Or migrating an existing Artsy app to k8s? Joey just mentioned Gemini

# What are some useful Hokusai commands?

List out a bunch of commands that we use on a regular basis and break down what's happening in them
