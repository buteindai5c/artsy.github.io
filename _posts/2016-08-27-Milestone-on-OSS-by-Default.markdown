The main Artsy.net website for the desktop, Force, was our first Artsy application to open it's source code, Craig and Brennan did it [back in 2014][force_oss]. Force's public offering laid the groundwork for the iOS OSS projects to come afterwards: [Eidolon][eidolon_oss], [Eigen][eigen_oss], [Energy][energy_oss] and [Emergence][emergence_oss].

Force wasn't quite Open Source by Default though, it represented a _really_ important step for  Artsy's OSS perspective but was not the end goal. We were opening our source, but not opening our process.

This month both [Force][force_gh], the desktop version of Artsy.net and [Microgravity][mg_gh], the mobile version - moved to being built entirely in the open. Read on to find out how.
