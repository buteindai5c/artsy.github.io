Welcome back to my series on writing for engineers. In the last post, we discussed [technical writing on the
web][ash_post] from an individual's perspective: how do you get started? how do you leverage the web? how do you
improve? In today's post, I want to change directions; instead of focusing on how _individuals_ write, we'll
discuss how _teams_ write.

<!-- more -->

To get started, I want to return the quote that opened up my first post. When
[interviewed by the New York Times developer blog](https://open.nytimes.com/five-questions-with-orta-therox-d5bb9659c50b),
Artsy alumnus [Orta][] said:

> One of my colleagues, Ash Furrow, is really the powerhouse behind improving the state of our public
> documentation. He runs weekly writing workshops internally and always encourages achievements as being
> post-worthy. Sometimes the best practice is to have someone who cares encouraging you. It works for me.

This post is going to pick this quote apart, but first I want to address something upfront:

**If you're thinking about helping others write, then you should do it**. Having the desire to help others write is
the only qualification for _actually helping_. You might think that in order to help others write, you should first
become a proficient writer yourself. This is backwards. I became the writing powerhouse that Orta mentions _by
helping others write_.

Let's think about this in terms of coding. When you help teach someone, _you also_ end up learning a lot. Assisting
others solidifies concepts _for you_ and helps _you_ hone your own skills. We recognize that engineers are ready to
mentor other engineers long before they become _experts_; indeed, it's usually _through mentoring_ that they become
experts.

This is how writing works, too.

Okay let's dive in.

## Just Show Up

> [Ash] runs weekly writing workshops.

Most of success is honestly just showing up. By itself, having a time and space set aside for colleagues to come
and write every week has pushed the team culture towards valuing writing. But it took time.

Six months after I started running weekly office hours, no one was really showing up. One or two people here and
there, but that was it. Orta said that he'd have cancelled the event by then, due to lack of interest. Here's the
thing, though: the value of the writing office hours transcends just what gets written. Having a weekly place to
come to write tells the team that _writing is important_. It says something, to have writing office hours, even if
no one shows up.

At first, writing office hours were aspirational. That's okay. There are still weeks where no one shows up. That's
okay, too. Besides, even if no one showed up, _I_ still got an hour to write, so it was definitely worth my time.

But Orta had a point: people weren't showing up, so I looked at that problem. I asked around and it turned out that
people were interested in _sharing knowledge_ but weren't always keen to write a blog post. So I changed my
approach.

Nowadays when I announce the writing office hours at our [weekly engineering standup][standup], I am clear that it
isn't _just_ for writing. I now let people know that this is a place where they can come for help with whatever
knowledge-sharing they're interested in. Let's take a look at a few examples:

- An engineer wanted to speak at a conference, so they brought their ideas and we outlined a talk proposal.
- A product manager wanted to document how Artsy's product team works, so we worked on turning that documentation
  into a public blog post.
- An engineer was planning an architecture review meeting to get the team up to speed on how some of our systems
  worked. They brought their slides and we went through the presentation together; I gave some feedback on what
  worked well and what was unclear.
- An engineer had an idea for a blog post, but the post was too big and they felt overwhelmed. They brought their
  outline and we worked to break it into several smaller posts.

So you can see that writing office hours grew to include more than just writing. And as the event helped more
people accomplish their knowledge-sharing goals, I folded those success stories into my weekly standup pitch.

I still call the event "writing office hours" because it rolls of the tongue better than "knowledge-sharing office
hours", but that's basically what they've become!

## Frame Deliverables as Blog Posts

> [Ash] always encourages achievements as being post-worthy.

// TODO: talk about how I look for things to suggest people write about, how I encourage them, how I remind them
about writing office hours, and how I follow-up with them.

## Sharing is Caring

> Sometimes the best practice is to have someone who cares encouraging you.
