## Context

### Artsy is pretty new to product teams

so we're still feeling out how these product teams will/should work together

We're seeing a lot of sharing of previous experiences in this process

In our Q1 retrospective, our PDDE organization decided to keep our teams more constant than they had previously
been.

- We were previously allowing team changes quarterly, which resulted in significant quarterly ramp-up time.

### This was driven by an engineering team, not mandated/handed down from management

It's a good reflection of our engineering culture & how we create our own engineering culture

Benefit: team agreements can be a good way to put your culture into practice (and/or further shape your culture)

Is there a way to tie this to our engineering core values?

- Is the whole process related to core values? Are the individual habits a team agrees to related to core values?

- Ash's blog post -
  [https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/22/engineering-guiding-principles/](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/22/engineering-guiding-principles/) -
  why do this at all?

## Overview of process

### Steps

Describe it in a few sentences

## Benefits

### The brainstorm itself is incredibly valuable

You look at _how_ the team works instead of what the team is working on

- Forces you to discuss soft skills that you don't often discuss, in a context that you don't usually discuss them.
  (with other IC's, with your close collaborators, ....)

- This reminds me of the talk "Ask vs Guess Culture" by Katherine Wu -
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk)

Maybe short-sighted, but at least for now, Steve has seen more value out of the brainstorm than the agreement
itself, because of all the learning you do about each others' habits and values

- This is probably related to the above point about quickening the "feeling out"/"forming" stage of joining a new
  team

- Maybe this will prove incorrect as team agreements live longer (or actually get one done)

### Adam's angle: the process has helped confirm that the team shared interest in team dynamics & the process of

collaboration across the team

As a new member it's nice to know that information

Steve: when joining a new team, there's often a period of "feeling it out" - where I'm afraid to verbalize an
opinion because I'm not sure how the team feels about it. The team working agreement process has definitely helped
lessen this feeling

Is this related to forming/storming/norming/performing?

### Galleries: Better engagement in sprint activities since implementing a team working agreement

The team agreed sprint meetings were valuable

We got a lot out of making slogans for the items.

- "Pair by default", "Incremental improvement over consistency" - got introduced during the discussions & have
  helped solidify the values & habits in agile ceremonies

- They've sort of become the _team's_ values

- There's something to the slogan aspect - it's a bite-size phrase that can inspire members to remember the team
  values

### Long term benefits

When new team members join, they'll have an up-to-date reference of how the team likes to work together.

It will introduce existing team members to the new team members' preferred methods of working.

We are excited to see individual growth as these values and practices become habit/second-nature.

## Challenges

### Not really knowing what qualifies for the team working agreement.

We use the word habit instead of discipline to try to guide the statements to be more appropriate for a team
agreement

Suggest categories, sample habits, & questions to ask heading into the brainstorm

- Helps avoid spending time about things that are not habits or values (i.e. "we should try X next sprint")

### Works great when you've got a team that is well-established and probably already in alignment on a lot of things,

but what about a team that is newer, or not necessarily in agreement?

It is hard to extract an "agreement" when the team isn't very much alignment. It becomes a lot of opinions held
strongly by a very small portion of the team, which is a hard thing to "agree" on.

### Distributed team?

Using real post-its & in-person conversations vs a tool like Miro

- Is there a difference in the ease of trying out different groupings?

This is only one aspect of the challenges of working with a distributed team

- It's also an opportunity to get better at being a distributed team

- A lot of the challenges you'd face here for a distributed team aren't much different than the challenges you'd
  face for other activities with a distributed team

  - That doesn't mean they're easy

### It takes effort to make sure one person isn't introducing their bias into the agreement

From early on - need to make sure samples presented aren't biased by the person presenting the exercise

But also when the brainstorm ideas are distilled into an agreement, it is probably easy for the person doing that
to introduce their bias

Possible solutions:

- Ashley & I paired on distillation process

- Voting or survey after distillation

Example - meetings on Grow. Lots of different opinions. How do we distill them into one or a few unifying
statements that we can all agree upon? How do we do this without introducing the bias of the person distilling the
brainstorm?

### Need to follow through on all steps, get it done pretty quickly

Purchase put the distillation on one person, and it hasn't progressed

Team working agreement isn't high-pri in relation to sprint work, so get it done quickly or it will stagnate

It's important to revisit the agreement often. If it gets stale, it will become unused.

### What does it mean to have a team working agreement?

How do you enforce it? **Do** you enforce it?

It's a great artifact, but there's non-obvious work involved in turning it from an agreement to "the team culture".

What do you do when not all members of the team are on-board with the agreement (or not on-board with parts of the
agreement)?

note: this might be a good way to end the article - a bunch of questions that we can't answer. Call to action - if
you've done this and/or know the answers, help!
