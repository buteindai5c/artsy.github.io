The culture at Artsy is driven by every team member, not mandated or handed down from above. TODO: Something about
how that culture birthed a wave of team working agreements.

<!-- more -->

Artsy Engineering is part of a larger organization we call PDDE (Product, Design, Data, and Engineering). PDDE is
divided into several product teams, and each team contains at least one representative from product, design, data,
and engineering. Each PDDE team delivers product solutions targeted to a specific product need.

Until recently, those teams could expect a significant change in team members every quarter, as we encouraged
engineers to explore other teams. The purpose of this practice was to spread knowledge throughout the organization,
and give folks the opportunity to keep themselves aligned with projects they found most interesting.

The downside of this practice was that it made teams feel short-lived, impermanent, and unstable. Some teams were
hit harder than others, and they'd see their team completely turn over.

We still encourage team members to explore other teams, but we no longer schedule it quarterly. This has made our
teams feel more stable and long-living. It also has allowed us to start building deeper team identity. Team Working
Agreements are a tool we've introduced to help establish identity.

## How did Team Working Agreements come about at Artsy?

The current breakdown of our PDDE organization is relatively new; it's also an on-going process. We are still
feeling out how these teams will/should work together. One of the core beliefs at Artsy is that when you are a part
of something - a process, a team, a culture - you are empowered to make impactful changes to it.

So when Adam saw that his team was missing ???TODO: Adam, why did galleries first introduce an agreement???, he
suggested a Team Working Agreement. It went really well, and working agreements have since spread to multiple
teams. We've done a lot of learning and sharing of experiences with each other.

## What's a Team Working Agreement? (suggested heading for "Overview of process")

## Overview of process

### Steps

Describe it in a few sentences:

1. Teach team about team working agreements
2. Conduct a brainstorming meeting
  - https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/agile/team-working-agreement.md#procedure
3. Distill and translate brainstorming ideas into slogan-like habits
4. Vote on the top 5 habits

## Why establish a Team Working Agreement?

### The brainstorm itself is incredibly valuable.

You look at _how_ the team works instead of what the team is working on

- Forces you to discuss soft skills that you don't often discuss, in a context that you don't usually discuss them.
  (with other IC's, with your close collaborators, ....)

- This reminds me of the talk "Ask vs Guess Culture" by Katherine Wu -
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk)

Maybe short-sighted, but at least for now, Steve has seen more value out of the brainstorm than the agreement
itself, because of all the learning you do about each others' habits and values

- This is probably related to the above point about quickening the "feeling out"/"forming" stage of joining a new
  team

- Maybe this will prove incorrect as team agreements live longer (or actually get one done)

### Adam's angle: the process has helped confirm that the team shared interest in team dynamics & the process of

collaboration across the team

As a new member it's nice to know that information

Steve: when joining a new team, there's often a period of "feeling it out" - where I'm afraid to verbalize an
opinion because I'm not sure how the team feels about it. The team working agreement process has definitely helped
lessen this feeling

Is this related to forming/storming/norming/performing?

### Galleries: Better engagement in sprint activities since implementing a team working agreement

The team agreed sprint meetings were valuable

We got a lot out of making slogans for the items.

- "Pair by default", "Incremental improvement over consistency" - got introduced during the discussions & have
  helped solidify the values & habits in agile ceremonies

- They've sort of become the _team's_ values

- There's something to the slogan aspect - it's a bite-size phrase that can inspire members to remember the team
  values

### Long term benefits

When new team members join, they'll have an up-to-date reference of how the team likes to work together.

It will introduce existing team members to the new team members' preferred methods of working.

We are excited to see individual growth as these values and practices become habit/second-nature.

## What are some challenges with Team Working Agreements?

### Uncertainty about what the agreement should include.

Some teams have struggled to identify what belongs on a team agreement. Should it describe our team values? Habits?
Procedures? Rules?

It likely varies from team to team what you want here. It's definitely important that you identify what you're
looking for up front, and make it clear heading into the brainstorm. Suggest categories, sample habits, & questions
to ask heading into the brainstorm, and keep them visible during the meeting.

That might not be enough, though. On one team, we went into the brainstorm in search of values and habits. We ended
up with almost exclusively values, which seemed like a win at the time. Several months later, we're still
regretting that we didn't do more with habits and procedures. We've been supplementing things like "JIRA ticket
hygiene and workflow" to our agreement as we go, but getting aligned on this earlier would have saved us a lot of
time.

### They are hard to define for teams that lack a well-established identity.

For a team that has been together for a while, and which has established an identity, the agreement is likely to
affirm many things the team is already believing and doing. For a newer team, or a team that is not very aligned on
their identity, the agreement is harder to pin down. Many opinions will surface, and they may be in conflict with
each other.

### Facilitating the brainstorm on a distributed team.

Some of our teams were able to brainstorm with everyone on-site. They were able to rely on post-it notes and
in-person conversations, and read each other's non-verbal communication. Other teams needed to accommodate remote
members, and used tools like Miro (TODO: link) to facilitate. This _can_ present a challenge...but if you're
already a distributed team, they are likely the same types of challenges you've worked to overcome for _all_
meetings.

The differences are worth noting, though. The importance of reading each other's non-verbal communication is
magnified when you're having conversations about identity. It's quicker to organize and re-organize real-life
post-its than virtual post-its in an online tool. These are all opportunities to get better at being a distributed
team.

### It takes effort to make sure one person isn't introducing their bias into the agreement.

From early on - need to make sure samples presented aren't biased by the person presenting the exercise

But also when the brainstorm ideas are distilled into an agreement, it is probably easy for the person doing that
to introduce their bias

Possible solutions:

- Ashley & I paired on distillation process

- Voting or survey after distillation

Example - meetings on Grow. Lots of different opinions. How do we distill them into one or a few unifying
statements that we can all agree upon? How do we do this without introducing the bias of the person distilling the
brainstorm?

### Need to follow through on all steps, get it done pretty quickly

Purchase put the distillation on one person, and it hasn't progressed

Team working agreement isn't high-pri in relation to sprint work, so get it done quickly or it will stagnate

It's important to revisit the agreement often. If it gets stale, it will become unused.

### What does it mean to have a team working agreement?

How do you enforce it? **Do** you enforce it?

It's a great artifact, but there's non-obvious work involved in turning it from an agreement to "the team culture".

What do you do when not all members of the team are on-board with the agreement (or not on-board with parts of the
agreement)?

note: this might be a good way to end the article - a bunch of questions that we can't answer. Call to action - if
you've done this and/or know the answers, help!
