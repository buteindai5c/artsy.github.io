The culture at Artsy is driven by every team member, not mandated or handed down from above. TODO: Something about
how that culture birthed a wave of team working agreements.

TODO: establish consistency of language & title case for "team working agreement"/"working agreement"/"team
agreement"/"agreement"?

Artsy Engineering is part of a larger organization we call PDDE (Product, Design, Data, and Engineering). PDDE is
divided into several product teams, and each team contains at least one representative from product, design, data,
and engineering. Each PDDE team delivers product solutions targeted to a specific product need.

Until recently, those teams could expect a significant change in team members every quarter, as we encouraged
engineers to explore other teams. The purpose of this practice was to spread knowledge throughout the organization,
and give folks the opportunity to keep themselves aligned with projects they found most interesting.

The downside of this practice was that it made teams feel short-lived, impermanent, and unstable. Some teams were
hit harder than others - they'd see their team completely turn over every quarter.

We've abandoned the practice of shuffling teams every quarter. It was too much change, too often. We still
encourage team members to explore other teams; we just don't schedule everyone to pursue a change at the same time.

As a result, our teams feel more stable and long-living. We're able to build deeper team identity. We've found one
tool particularly helpful in finding and building team identity: Team Working Agreements.

## How did Team Working Agreements come about at Artsy?

The current breakdown of our PDDE organization is relatively new; it's also an on-going process. We are still
feeling out how these teams will/should work together. One of the core beliefs at Artsy is that when you are a part
of something - a process, a team, a culture - you are empowered to make impactful changes to it.

Since being pioneered by Adam's team, team working agreements have spread to most of our engineering teams. They've
been a learning opportunity for all of us, and a chance for our team members to share experiences and practices
with each other.

## What's a Team Working Agreement?

### Steps

Describe it in a few sentences:

1. Teach team about team working agreements
2. Conduct a brainstorming meeting

- https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/agile/team-working-agreement.md#procedure

3. Distill and translate brainstorming ideas into slogan-like habits
4. Vote on the top 5 habits

## Why establish a Team Working Agreement?

### The brainstorm itself is incredibly valuable.

Dedicated time to talk about values, habits, and processes is incredibly helpful to a team, yet rarely scheduled.
The brainstorm for a Team Working Agreement can fill this void.

During the agreement brainstorm the team looks at _how_ they work, instead of looking at _what_ work they're doing.
It's similar to what you might get out of a retro but at a higher level. It offers time to discuss "soft" skills
that you don't often discuss, in a context that you don't usually discuss them - with other individual
contributors, and with your closest collaborators.

      When joining a new team, there's often a period of "feeling it out" - where I'm afraid to verbalize an
      opinion because I'm not sure how the team feels about it. The team working agreement process has definitely
      helped lessen this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a [great talk by Katherine Wu named "Ask vs Guess Culture"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTXf6qyaGk). 
      "Guess" culture is when you try to guess what a person wants or is thinking; "Ask" culture is when you flat out 
      ask them. Team Agreement brainstorms are a really neat way to *ask* your team how they want to work, instead of
      spending many sprints trying to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might be short-sighted, and maybe my opinion will change over time, but I have seen the most value out of
      *the actual brainstorm* than the agreement itself. My teams have learned so much about each others' habits and
      values.

      The process has helped confirm that the team shared interest in team dynamics & the process of collaboration 
      across the team. As a new member it's nice to know that information.

### It can lead to better engagement in sprint activities.

One of our teams established in their agreement that sprint meetings were valuable. This might seem too obvious to
put in an agreement, but it portrays clearly to everyone that they should attend all sprint meetings and be
actively engaged.

The same team got a lot out of making slogans for the items in their agreement. Phrases like "Pair by default" and
"Incremental improvement over consistency" were introduced during the brainstorm. They've since become mantras for
the team to refer to during sprint work and ceremonies. Team values and habits solidify through this kind of
repetition.

### The agreement provides on-boarding documentation.

When new members join a team, it takes time for them to adjust. A team working agreement provides an up-to-date
reference on the team's preferred methods of working. The agreement isn't set in stone, and as the team changes
it's important to update it...but having it in writing helps new members acclimate quickly.

## What are some challenges with Team Working Agreements?

### Uncertainty about what the agreement should include.

Some teams have struggled to identify what belongs on a team agreement. Should it describe our team values? Habits?
Procedures? Rules?

It likely varies from team to team what you want here. It's definitely important that you identify what you're
looking for up front, and make it clear heading into the brainstorm. Suggest categories, sample habits, & questions
to ask heading into the brainstorm, and keep them visible during the meeting.

Be cautious about introducing individual bias, though.

      Having been through a brainstorm on another team where I felt like we spent too much time talking about things I deemed "too specific," I made a strong effort on another team to constrain the suggestions. To me, team values were really important for this new team - and I did such a good job of encouraging those types of suggestions that it's pretty much all we ended up with.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this made me feel like I understood the values of my team better, we're months later _still_ paying for this bias. Our agreement lacked important procedural and tactical definition. We've been adding things like JIRA hygiene and responsibilities of project leaders as they come up, but I would not push a working agreement brainstorm so strongly in one direction again.

### Agreements are hard to define for teams without a well-established identity.

For a team that has been together for a while, and which has established an identity, the agreement is likely to
affirm many things the team is already believing and doing. For a newer team, or a team that is not very aligned on
their identity, the agreement is harder to pin down. Many opinions will surface, and they may be in conflict with
each other.

While this is indeed challenging, it is also important to note that teams that lack identity value _greatly_ from
the team agreement brainstorm. Provided there is psychological safety, this is a really great time for the team to
learn about what matters to each other, and move toward establishing an identity.

### Facilitating the brainstorm can be difficult on a distributed team.

Some of our teams were able to brainstorm with everyone on-site. They were able to rely on post-it notes and
in-person conversations, and read each other's non-verbal communication. Other teams needed to accommodate remote
members, and used tools like [Miro](http://miro.com/) to facilitate. This _can_ present a challenge...but if you're
already a distributed team, they are likely the same types of challenges you've worked to overcome for _all_
meetings.

The differences are worth noting, though. The importance of reading each other's non-verbal communication is
magnified when you're having conversations about identity. It's quicker to organize and re-organize real-life
post-its than virtual post-its in an online tool. These are all opportunities to get better at being a distributed
team.

### It takes effort to make sure one person isn't introducing their bias into the agreement.

It's important for the working agreement brainstorm to provide an environment in which every team member is heard.
Even if your team is successful at this, there are still opportunities for individual bias to affect the agreement.

We saw earlier how bias can appear when the examples provided for the brainstorm are too narrowly scoped.

We recognized another bias vector in the distillation of the brainstorm into an actual agreement. If this is
handled by a single person, it's very possible for them to produce an agreement that misrepresents _the rest_ of
the team. To counter this, we've had multiple team members pair on the distillation process. Feedback on the
initial draft of the agreement is also important to ensure it does not misrepresent the team's ideas.

The problem of introducing bias to the distillation process is most challenging with topics that are disputed
across the team. One of our teams spent a lot of time talking about meetings in their brainstorm, but struggled to
come to consensus on them. No single person, or even a pair, could add a disputed topic like this to the agreement
without introducing their personal bias. In this specific case, the team chose to leave meetings off the agreement
until they could reach consensus.

### Team health is easy to postpone when you have important product work to do.

One of our teams put the act of distilling the brainstorm notes into an agreement on one person. That person became
busier than expected, didn't get a chance to write the agreement, and the team's agreement did not progress. (TODO:
fact-check. I have notes that this happened to Purchase, but I don't know if they progressed or not.)

Just as personal self-care gets put on the back burner during stressful times, creating a working agreement is easy
to bump down the backlog during intense periods of sprint work. The longer a team drags out the working agreement
process, the more context is lost from the original brainstorm. We recommend not letting your working agreement
linger.

It's also important to revisit the agreement often. It is a living document, not one-and-done. Review the agreement
as a team occasionally; update the agreement as your team learns how to collaborate better; cultivate the
agreement. If an agreement gets stale, it will become inaccurate, meaningless, and unused.

### What does it even mean to have a team working agreement?

A team working agreement is a neat artifact. The brainstorm process has great value. But there is non-obvious work
involved in turning a team working agreement into the team culture. We have many questions that we aren't sure how
to answer:

- How do you enforce the agreement?
- **Should** you enforce the agreement?
- How do you get the entire team to embrace it?
- What happens when the agreement is violated or disrespected?

If you're using working agreements on your team and you've got answers for us, or you want to start using them and
have more questions, we'd love to hear from you!
