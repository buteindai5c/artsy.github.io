<!-- OUTLINE -->

Intro: You write some HTML, add a bunch of tables, and it looks great in the browser. Done, right? Not so fast. How
does it look in...Outlook 2003? Creating emails is harder than it may seem at first.

<!-- more -->

CTA: This is where MJML comes in.

Image/code: email that looks good in browser, does not render well in certain clients

Ordeal: How does MJML get us from A to B? What are the issues with it? Both marketing-specific stuff and rails
stuff. MJML slack community. Mini-tutorial on <mj-head> as global stylesheet

Reward: Emails that render well on every client! Way more abstraction (in a nice way)! Modularity! This is a thing
that came from the CRM team, not initially from the Engineering team. We found MJML when we were getting ready to
revamp our emails last year.

Image/code: input MJML vs. output HTML

Return/reflection: organization + naming conventions for Matt. Learning curve to <mj-head> and <mj-body> setup,
unintuitive logic at times for Erik. Adds rendering time? What would that mean for 100+ emails at once?
