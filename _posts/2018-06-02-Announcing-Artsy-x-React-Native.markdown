We want more people to feel like they are making informed decisions around React Native. One of our strategies so
far has been to talk with native mobile teams about how and why we made our decisions, and whether those same
trade-offs work for them.

To migrate from making these one-offs, we want to try consolidate a dense amount of knowledge into a single event.
So, we reached out to the Facebook engineers about running an event together and came up with
[Artsy x React Native](/artsy-x-react-native.html) - a one day conference aimed at helping people understand what
it's like to add React Native to an existing app.
